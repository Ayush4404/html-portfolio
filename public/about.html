<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Ayush Rawat. I'm currently a student at CGC Landran, where I'm pursuing a degree in B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. My journey in tech has been fueled by a keen interest in coding and a passion for learning new things.

<p>In my free time, I love listening to music and immersing myself in manga. These hobbies provide a great balance to my academic pursuits and keep me creatively inspired.
I have a strong passion for making money and envisioning my future in entrepreneurship.</p>
 
<p>One of my significant achievements includes securing second place in a videography event during my first year of college, as well as winning first place on National Science Day as part of a team of three. These experiences have not only honed my skills but also reinforced my determination to excel in various fields.
Looking ahead, my ultimate goal is to start my own company.</p>
