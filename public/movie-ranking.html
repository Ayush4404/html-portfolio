<h1>The best movies acoording to ayush</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<hr />
<h3>12th FAIL</h3>
<p>Because it tells about the struggle of a village kid whose town was suffering from corruption but he didn't give up on his dream to become a govt officer. </p>
<hr />
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>Its one of my favourite because it tells about how learning is not just about cramming and scoring good marks but learning the actual essence pf something.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Chichore</h3>
<p>One of the best movies which tells about how being a looser is also good ,as being a looser is not your work but staying a loser is your reponsibility.</p>
